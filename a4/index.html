<h1>Homework 4 - Jonathan Lee</h1> 

<h2>Normal Distribution</h2>
<div id="normalDis"></div>

<h2>Normal Distribution Mean</h2>
<div id="normalMeanDis"></div>

<p>Yes. It has roughly the same shape of a normal distribution as problem 2. It is however less defined given that we have a smaller sample set of 100 versus 1000. 
It does not have the same x-scale. In Problem 2, the mean was to hover around 0 with a standard deviation of 1. In our normal mean distribution, we would expect the means
collected from the 100 arrays to hover around the mean of the normal distribution itself which was 0. As a result, our x-scale doesn't extend from -3 to 3 like in Problem 1 but more tightly groups itself around 0 (e.g ~-0.06 to 0.6) once we take the mean. </p>

<h2>Lognormal Distribution</h2>
<div id="lognormalDis"></div>

<h2>Lognormal Mean Distribution</h2>
<div id="lognormalMeanDis"></div>
<p>No. It does not have roughly the same shape as our lognormal distribution. In fact, the lognormal mean distribution looks similarly like the normal distribution exhibited 
in Problem 1. In our lognormal distribution, our results are tightly grouped around 0-2 and quickly taper off with higher values. As a result, once we take the mean of 
our lognormal array, we would expect the mean to hover around that area. Despite their lower frequency, the higher values still impact the overall mean. As a result, the mean 
is not specifically centered on the highest frequence value ,1, but rather slightly right of it (e.g 1.5 - 2). The x-scale therefore is very much unlike the one from the previous problem. It is much narrower focusing on the means of the distribution itself which all will hover around the range mentioned above. </p>

<h2>Exponential Distribution</h2>
<div id="expoDis"></div>

<h2>Exponential Mean Distribution</h2>
<div id="expoMeanDis"></div>

<p>The exponential distributon is similar in appearance to the lognormal distribution. Heavily concentrated in lower numbers and tapering off as the values increase. The scale is however different compared to the lognormal distribution as it does consist of lower values. Similar to the lognomrmal mean distribution, the exponential mean distribution looks disimilar 
to the distribution it was derived from. It shows characteristics of a normal distribution as it takes the means of the exponential distribution from the previous problem. The x-scales are also fundamentally different given how each distribution was derived. While a significant majority of the values from the exponential mean distribution exist from 0 - 0.5, the x-scale for our exponential mean distribution is slightly skewed right (e.g 0.91 - 1.09) given the fact that the distribution tapers outward as values increase. </p>

<h2>Gamma Distribution</h2>
<div id="gammaDis"></div>

<h2>Gamma Mean Distribution</h2>
<div id="gammaMeanDis"></div>


<p>At a=10, the gamma mean distribution does look similar to the distribution it was originally derived from. This is most due to the fact that at a=10, the gamma distribution
does look similarly to a normal distribution. The mean distribution similar to the previous problems also looks very much similar to a normal distribution. The gamma distribution
in contrast to the mean distribution is skewed to the left. The mean distribution is more centered such as a normal distribution would be. Similar to previous problems, the 
x-scale is more central to the mean and of a much narrower range which is to be expected given that it was taken from the mean of the distribution itself. </p>

<h2>Cauchy Distribution</h2>
<div id="cauchyDis"></div>

<h2>Cauchy Mean Distribution</h2>
<div id="cauchyMeanDis"></div>

<p>The cauchy mean distribution exhibits characteristics of a gaussian mean distribution as seen in Problems 3 and 5. In contrast to those two which utilized a gaussian distribution to derive the mean distribution, the cauchy distribution consists of distinct outliers occassionally given that we are taking the ratios of two random gaussian variables. Without removing
outliers in our data set, our x-scales for both the cauchy distribution and its mean distribution invoke a much more significant range given that we must account for the 
few outliers in our distribution. Since we are taking the mean for our mean distribution, this range is reduced and we can more accurately see the the mean distributions resemblance 
to a normal distribution such as in Problem 3 and 5. As a result of these few outliers, our histograms for both problems make it difficult to discern what type of distribution the majority of the values resemble. We are looking at such a large range that we cannot see finite differences (e.g between ~-20 to 20). If we were to increase the number of samples or remove the outliers, we would begin to see more accurately a normal distribution as seen in 3 and 5.  </p>
